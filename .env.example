# OpenAI API Configuration
# ---------------------------------
# 1. Replace 'your_api_key_here' with your actual OpenAI API key
# 2. Rename this file from '.env.example' to '.env'
# 3. Make sure .env is in your .gitignore file (it already is in this project)

OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Note: Never commit your actual API key to version control.
# The .env file is already in .gitignore to prevent accidental commits.
