Though the platform maintains a semblance of order, it's clear that much of its functionality has gone dormant over the years.\n\nThe pressing issue is that a vital piece of Dier's ship hardware has been stolen, leaving him stranded. His contact, known only as 'Sable,' should have delivered critical information by now but is conspicuously absent. Dier's wealth and influence are of little use here in this forsaken outpost where currency and clout take a backseat to survival and technology.\n\nWhat will Dier do in search of 'Sable' and his missing ship component?"}
