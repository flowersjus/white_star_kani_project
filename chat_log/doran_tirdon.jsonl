As he regains his bearings, the lights flicker every 20 seconds, casting short, ominous shadows across the corridors.\n\nHe can't remember how he ended up here but knows he must first stabilize the power and find out what brought him to this enigmatic place. There's an uneasy feeling in the air, hinting that he's not alone.\n\nWhat's your first move, Doran? Explore the ship, inspect your surroundings, or try to access any operational systems?"}

The room he finds himself in seems to have once been the ship's laboratory. Tables are strewn with ancient equipment and glass containers, many now overtaken by vines and crawling plants. The air is damp and carries a mix of metallic and earthy scents.\n\nThe flickering light reveals some scattered papers, notes, and what looks like a passkey badge with an unfamiliar emblem on it lying on the floor. An access panel is partially ajar on one wall, and a single doorway leads out into the darkened corridors beyond.\n\nDeciding that he has gathered all the information he can from this area, Doran steels himself to push forward and explore deeper into the ship's interior. \n\nWould you like to take any of these items or interact with the environment further before moving on?"}
