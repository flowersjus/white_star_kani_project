The place is a hive of scum and villainy\u2014perfect for both deals and double-crosses. Benden is on edge; his contact, known only as 'Whisper,' is conspicuously delayed. Around him, shady figures eye each other cautiously, ready to bolt or brawl at any moment.\n\nHe's here for a deal, one involving goods of questionable legality, and without Whisper, things are precarious. Time ticks away, and Benden knows he must find out why Whisper is late and if it\u2019s part of a larger play. \n\nWhat will Benden do? Will he start asking questions around the station, or perhaps check in on his inventory and credits to prepare for any turns this situation might take?"}
