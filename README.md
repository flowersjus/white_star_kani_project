# White Star + Kani AI Project

An AI-powered solo TTRPG system built with Kani and the White Star ruleset.

---

## üß† Project Overview

This project uses [Kani](https://github.com/zhudotexe/kani) to serve as a fully interactive AI Game Master for solo sci-fi tabletop RPG sessions using the **White Star** rules.

- Kani model: `OpenAIEngine` using `gpt-4o`
- AI is given structured access to JSON files to persist and manipulate state
- All tools are registered via `AIFunction`

## üîç Technical Decisions

### ‚ùó Kani Decorator Issue

The Kani version on PyPI **does not export** `@ai_function` correctly. Several attempts to use `@ai_function()` failed because:

- PyPI install did not expose `kani.registry`
- GitHub install did not include `@ai_function` in `__init__.py`
- Even editable installs failed to register decorated functions properly

**Solution:** Manually wrapped each tool using:

```python
from kani.ai_function import AIFunction
...
add_inventory = AIFunction(add_inventory)
```

This works reliably and avoids the broken decorator.

## üí° Tips for Development

- If the AI throws a `TypeError` about `function has no attribute 'name'`, you're likely importing an undecorated or unwrapped function ‚Äî remember to use `AIFunction()` manually
- Your OpenAI key is stored in `.env` file (loaded via dotenv)
- You can register more tools at any time by importing and adding to the `functions=[...]` list
- If you ever reinstall Kani and decorators start working, you can refactor to `@ai_function()`
